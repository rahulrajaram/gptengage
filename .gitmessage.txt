# Remember to:
#   - Capitalize the subject line
#   - Use the imperative mood in the subject line ("Add" not "Added")
#   - Do not end the subject line with a period
#   - Separate subject from body with a blank line
#   - Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
#   - Wrap the body at 72 characters
